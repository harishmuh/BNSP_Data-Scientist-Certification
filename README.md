## **What is BNSP?**
* BNSP stands for Badan Nasional Sertifikasi Profesi, which translates to the National Professional Certification Body of Indonesia.
* BNSP is an independent institution established by the Indonesian government through Law No. 13 of 2003 concerning Manpower.
* BNSP has the authority to act as a personnel certification authority in Indonesia. Its main task is to conduct professional competency certification for workers across various sectors in Indonesia.
* BNSP is also responsible for developing national competency standards (SKKNI - Standar Kompetensi Kerja Nasional Indonesia).


## **What is the BNSP Data Scientist Certification?**
The BNSP Data Scientist Certification is a formal recognition issued by the Badan Nasional Sertifikasi Profesi (BNSP) in Indonesia that an individual possesses the competencies required to perform the tasks and responsibilities of a Data Scientist according to the national competency standards (SKKNI) for this profession.

* **Based on National Standards**: The certification is based on the SKKNI for Data Scientists, which outlines the specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to be competent in this field in Indonesia. These standards are developed by industry experts and stakeholders.
* **Assessment of Competency**: To obtain the certification, individuals must undergo a rigorous competency assessment conducted by a Lembaga Sertifikasi Profesi (LSP) that is licensed by BNSP for the Data Scientist scheme. This assessment typically involves: 
    * **Portfolio Review**: Evaluation of the candidate's past work and projects.
    * **Written Tests**: Assessing theoretical knowledge of data science concepts, methodologies, and tools.
    * **Practical Demonstrations/Simulations**: Showing the ability to apply data science techniques to solve real-world problems.
    * **Interviews**: Further probing the candidate's understanding and experience.
    * **Formal Recognition**: If an individual successfully passes the competency assessment, they are awarded a BNSP certificate as a "Certified Data Scientist." This certificate is a formal acknowledgment of their professional competence in this field, recognized nationally across Indonesia.

## **What does it mean if a person has this certificate as a Certified Data Scientist by BNSP?**

* **Nationally Recognized Competence**: It signifies that the individual has been independently assessed and verified as competent to perform the duties of a Data Scientist according to the national standards in Indonesia.
* **Demonstrated Skills and Knowledge**: The certificate indicates that the person possesses the required knowledge and practical skills in areas such as:
  * Data collection and preprocessing.
  * Statistical analysis and modeling.
  * Machine learning algorithms and their application.
  * Data visualization and communication of insights.
  * Other Big data technologies 
  * Understanding of business objectives and translating them into data science problems.
